# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK3:

This task involves the creation of an interactive dashboard to visualize a dataset using popular data visualization tools.

The dashboard has been built using Tableau, one of the most widely-used business intelligence tools.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the tools used, suitable editor platforms, and the practical applications of this task.

# Tools Used:

# Tableau

Tableau is a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that helps in transforming raw data into interactive, insightful, and easily understandable dashboards.

It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, perform data manipulation, and create a variety of visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and more.

In the provided dashboard:

A bar chart shows sales distribution by country.

Another bar chart highlights the top 5 salespersons based on the amount.

A business summary section displays key metrics such as Boxes Shipped, Total Amount, and Shipment Count.

Color coding and interactive filtering are likely applied to enhance user experience and data readability.

# Data Sources

While not explicitly shown in the image, Tableau supports a range of data sources like Excel, CSV files, SQL databases, Google Sheets, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

For this task, the dataset probably includes sales transactions, customer geography, and shipment details.

# Editor Platforms You Can Use
In addition to Tableau, there are other platforms where similar dashboards can be created:

# Power BI

Developed by Microsoft, Power BI is another robust data visualization and business analytics tool.

Offers rich integrations with Microsoft Excel, Azure, SQL Server, and other cloud-based data sources.

Suitable for enterprises already within the Microsoft ecosystem.

# Dash (by Plotly)

Dash is a Python-based framework for building analytical web applications.

Ideal for users who prefer coding and need custom interactive dashboards.

It offers flexibility and integration with machine learning models and APIs.

# Google Data Studio (Looker Studio)

Free and cloud-based.

Best for lightweight, collaborative dashboard creation with integration to Google products (Sheets, BigQuery, Analytics).

# Jupyter Notebook with Plotly or Seaborn

More technical and code-driven.

Ideal for data scientists who want to integrate data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
